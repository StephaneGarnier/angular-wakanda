<p>
  Angular-Wakanda relies on several Open Source projects available on Github.
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/Wakanda/angular-wakanda">
  <h3>Wakanda/angular-wakanda</h3>
</a>

<p>
  It is the <strong>production</strong> repository for the connector. Bower and npm take version on it.
  <strong>Do not make any pull request on this repository.</strong>
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/Wakanda/sources-angular-wakanda">
  <h3>Wakanda/sources-angular-wakanda</h3>
</a>
<p>
  It is the <strong>development</strong> repository. It contains sources for the connector, but also
  a Wakanda solution, unit tests, end-to-end tests and a demo application.
  </br >
  As all of this is quite heavy, we did not want to include all of this stuff on
  the distribution repository, that's why we split them up.
  <strong>Pull requests must be opened on this repository.</strong>
</p>
